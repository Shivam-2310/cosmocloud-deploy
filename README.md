# 🚀 CosmoCloud DevOps Project

**CosmoCloud DevOps Project** sets up a scalable, multi-service web application using Kubernetes to demonstrate a microservices architecture with a **frontend**, **backend**, and **Redis database**. This project showcases Kubernetes deployments and services for multi-service orchestration.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a microservices architecture comprising the following components:

- **Frontend**: Hosts the user interface and interacts with users.
- **Backend**: Handles business logic, API endpoints, and data processing.
- **Redis Database**: An in-memory database caching data for faster access.

The services interact through Kubernetes services, demonstrating a distributed architecture.

### **System Architecture**

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

The architecture consists of:

1. **Frontend Service**:
   - The user interface built using web technologies.
2. **Backend Service**:
   - Implements application logic and APIs for communication with Redis.
3. **Redis Service**:
   - Used for in-memory caching, data storage, and fast data access.
